Case 701 - Believable burglar - stage 4

Those guys down at the precinct need to take your brain for one final spin.
This burglar has been a particularly slippery character and now they believe that they have them.
Luckily they have a have a witness statement from pierre zetland.
All they need is for you to do the detective work.

This time you must implement two functions:

- A testSuspect function that takes a suspect object as parameter from the data structure below.
Your function should return a number value indicating how many of their properties match the witness statement.
You should use conditional statements to compare the suspect's properties to the statement.

- A findGuilty function which traverses the array of suspects and returns the object representing the guilty suspect,
otherwise - return an empty object.

There are many possible ways of carrying out your duties,
but you should complete this task using ONLY the following
commands:

 - function testSuspect(suspectObj){}
 - function findGuilty(){}
 - if()

Witness statement:

I remember walking down the street and then I saw them. They were fairly tall, I think between a height of 165 and 184 cm. It's so hard to remember right now. They were carrying a orange tote bag. They brobably weigh between 58 and 85 kg. It was very dark and I could barely see, They seemed to be between the age of 30 and 41 years old. They had red hair. They wore cheap plastic glasses. I'll never forget their grey eyes. It's hard to say. Their expression seemed empty. I remember they had a dragon tattoo. I hope I never have to go through that again.
